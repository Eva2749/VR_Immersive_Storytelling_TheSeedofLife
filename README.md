# The Seed Of Life

## Story Background
There is a dying man John who suffers from the late stage liver cancer. Lying in the hospital, besides his own struggle as well as optimism, he looks at his beloved girlfriend Gabrielle, worrying that she will be the one who grieves his death the most.

One day he saw a design of a bone ash container, a degradable box, with seeds of trees in it, where the bone ash, a.k.a Ca5(OH)(PO4)3, can be used as a nutritional supplement for plants. He got an idea to help his girlfriend move on to her next chapter of life.


## User Experience
In our game, the audience will read the letter from John, and then be instructed to add ingredients, including bone ash, seeds, and water, into the degradable box, which will later be planted into the ground. Around the pit where the user drops the pot and waters the plant. The tree grows and then we welcome our final scene, where John conveys his best wishes to Gabrielle, hoping to accompany her in another form of life later on
